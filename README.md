# Large-Number-Factorial
Using string instead of int to make a Factorial, as int has a limit and will overflow if the factorial gets too big  
Using string we will have a problem if we run out of RAM, using the number to multiple by ones, tens, hundreds, ...  
Similar to how we multiple by hand

# Usage
You can compile the largeNumberFactorial.cpp or use the executable, if compiling please use c++14 or above
After running the executable/compile and run, just type in the number you want the factorial and it will output the factorial
